<h1>CEDERBERG TEA HOUSE</h1> 
<h3>Website Recreation for HTML5 Semantics</h3>
Origin page: [http://cederbergteahouse.com/](http://cederbergteahouse.com/)

This is an initial attempt at recreating the Cederberg Tea House webpage using HTML5 semantics. Having some trouble understanding how to achieve a good outline and schema (in addition to running into some gaps / running out of time on recreating the page).
